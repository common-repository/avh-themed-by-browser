== Description ==

The AVH Themed By Browser plugin gives you the ability to set a correlation between browser and theme.
The theme of your blog can change dynamically based on the browser the visitor is using.

Some idea's of uses:

* You have a great theme that looks fantastic, it's heavy on graphics and javascript. You can select a different theme for the Google bot, one doesn't use javascript that much and is leaner. The bot will process your page quicker and the visit will have less strain on your site.
* You have a blog about Playstation 3 games and news. You have settled on a theme but it uses iframes and you want users who surf your blog from their Playstation 3 to be able to use read your blog as well. Set a theme without iframes for those users.
